# üé® ColourPicker

üß™ Comprehensive test suite

üê≠ Lightweight

üèó Extensible

üñº Easily-stylable

## Live Demo
[Click here to view](http://samchristy.github.io/ColourPicker/)

## Installation
`npm install react-colour-picker`

### Usage
```typescript jsx
import { ColourPicker } from 'react-colour-picker';
import './App.css';

export default function App() {
    return (
        <ColourPicker onColourUpdate={(colour) => doSomething(colour)} />
    );
}
````
Most apps will probably be perfectly fine with `<input type="color" />` and there isn't a great 
deal this package can do on its own - you will most likely want to use it as a building block 
for a more complicated UI.

#### Styling
Fully stylable, using regular CSS, the following classes are made available:
```css
.colourPicker {/* Styles the main container*/}
.palette {/* The palette, in the middle */}
.hueScale { /* The hue scale, on the right */ }
.marker {/* The marker rings */}
.colourSwatch {/* The colour block and input, at the bottom */}
```

### Development
A [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) app is used, in `/demo`, not only
for the above demo page, but also for the actual development of the component; so we can benefit
from all of the niceties that CRA bundles, without lumbering then on the users of the npm
package! üòâ

#### To run the local demo:
```bash
cd demo && npm start
```
#### Tests:
```bash
npm test
```
